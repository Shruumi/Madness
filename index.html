        <h2>The series goes hard, I wanna make one!?</h2>
        <p>When I started making madness animations, there were no resources I could find
        that werent on newgrounds (which was blocked on the computer) other than this one
        really good video by this guy with a name I cant pronounce. So I made a website that
        hopefully is a place where you can get resources and tutorials and stuff.</p>
