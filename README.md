# Madness
When I started madness animation there was nowhere to learn except for newgrounds, which was blocked on my computer (and for good reason,) and a really good tutorial by a guy with a name I cant pronounce. **so,** I decided to make a site dedicated to learning madness animating, and a place to share them because why not.

# Funny Story!
The reason there is a resources page is because again, newgrounds is something some of us have blocked. So I instead had to go on the **SKECHIEST LOOKING WEBSITE I'VE EVER SEEN,** and download a spritesheet. So, that sucked. So I put an easy to use little page where you can download spritesheets and maybe even upload your own if I ever get really bored.

# Credits
I worked with my friend **Liam** to make this site, even though he doesn't have much knowledge of madness, and obviously, I **(shruumi)** worked on the site. ***IMPORTANT:*** This is an *unofficial* site and I am not affiliated with **krinkels** in any way. I just made this for fun and out of some necessity. Not all of us are allowed to go on newgrounds.







# I really hope this site doesn't get blocked lol.
